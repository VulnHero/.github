## What We Do

VulnHero is an AI-driven offensive security platform that unifies:

- **VulnHero Platform** – continuous full-stack security testing and exploit-aware risk scoring  
- **Vuln-Intel** – vulnerability & exploit intelligence with exploitability-first context  
- **Managed Penetration Testing (PTaaS)** – expert-led testing with continuous retesting  
- **Subdomain Takeover Protection** – continuous detection of abandoned & hijacked subdomains  

We help security teams cut scanner noise and focus on **what’s actually exploitable** across their attack surface.
