## What We Do

VulnHero is an AI-driven offensive security platform that helps teams cut scanner noise and focus on what’s actually exploitable across their attack surface.

We unify:

- **VulnHero Platform** – continuous full-stack security testing with exploit-aware risk scoring and validation  
- **Vuln-Intel** – vulnerability & exploit intelligence with exploitability-first, stack-aware context  
- **Managed Penetration Testing (PTaaS)** – expert-led testing, continuous retesting and operational reporting  
- **Subdomain Takeover Protection** – continuous detection of abandoned, misconfigured and hijacked subdomains
